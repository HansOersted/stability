# Finding Stability Proof from Data

> — 😒 *YOU SHOULD DO RESEARCH! —*  
> sneered a postdoc in Robotics while I was working on the data-driven method.

> That was when I realized: some so-called authorities dislike new talent.

**This repository takes stability proof out of the hands of authority — and puts it in yours.**

## 💡 What It Does

Given your tracking result, this repository automates the search for a stability proof  
— and updates the stability proof automatically in almost real-time.

## 🌐 About This Demo (SaaS User Side)

This repository is the **user-side (usr)** of the Stability Proof SaaS.  

For security and fair usage, the public server is protected by a **global, shared usage limit**  
(i.e., the quota is shared across all users, not per IP or per user).  
  
If the **global quota is exhausted** and the demo no longer runs,  
please contact me directly for extended access or collaboration.
